# AP Computer Science

This is a repo of all the assignments I did in AP Computer Science. This was my first programming class so it doesn't reflect my knowledge today. That being said, here are some good assignments to check out. Most are command line programs.


## FracCalcRedo

The first big project assigned to the class, its simply a fraction calculator. There is a lot of parsing strings.

## Visicalc

The last big project assigned to the class, its essentially a command line version of Microsoft Excel. The project ended up being cut short due to it being too complicated for the class.
